**OOP**

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects”, which can contain data and code: data in the form of attributes, and code in the form of methods.

**Classess**(theoreis or framework): A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class.

**Objects** (Specific application of those theories: An object is a specific instance of a class.

**Methods** (Calculations /actions we perform)

An object is a specific instance of a class. If "Consumer" is your class, then "John Smith buying groceries" is an object - a real example with actual data.
